4. The Term may be extended with the written consent of the Parties.

# TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT {-}

5. This Agreement may be terminated:
    i. without cause, by 10 days' prior written notice by either party, or
    ii. with cause, immediately upon material breach of any term of this Agreement by either party.
6. The Client shall promptly pay the Consultant for services performed before the effective date of termination. The Client shall now owe the Consultant compensation for any services performed following such date.

# COMPENSATION {-}

7.

8. The Client will be invoiced when the Services are complete.
9. Invoices submitted by the Consultant to the Client are due within 30 days of receipt.
